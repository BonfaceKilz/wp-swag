# wp-swag

This is Swag, the gamified, self-paced, xAPI enabled learning environment from Tunapanda!

## Installation

This is for installing the plugin locally on your machine:

1. Download this plugin as a zip file, using the "Clone or download" link at the top of this page.
2. Install the plugin into your WordPress installation.
3. For now, the plugin needs to live inside a directory called wp-swag. If you download it as a .zip file from GitHub, it will not be called that, so you need to rename the downloaded folder and call it wp-swag before you activate it.
4. Activate the plugin.
5. Go to _Settings >> Tunapanda Swag_ and follow the instructions there. This will help you to install required plugins and download course content from the Tunapanda server.

Enjoy!
