# What challenges is Swag designed to address?

## Unreliable Internet
Internet access is still unreliable and cost prohibitive in many communities. This means that great learning content, if it is cloud-based, is still out of reach for many people who could otherwise learn.

### How Swag solves the problem
Swag is designed to be completely functional offline. With a simple set up and about two gigabytes of data (which can be downloaded elsewhere then transported via sneakernet), any computer can become a server for a group of learners. Users can choose to sync whenever they choose to get newly created resources (or not at all)

## Material not tailored to local needs
Online learning materials are mostly not tailored for local needs. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have revolutionized the way education can be delivered. However, most MOOC courses are adapted from Western university courses and are not designed for East Africa.

### How Swag solves the problem
Swag makes it very easy for user to create their own interactive learning resources. Furthermore, all Swag content is released under a public license, which allows communities to adapt, remix, or update the materials to make them more appropriate for their own unique contexts. By using local languages and locally-relevant examples, the learning material can be even more powerful.

## Rapidly changing technology
Available materials, especially textbooks, can struggle to keep pace with advancements in technology. Since the field of IT can change very quickly, itâ€™s important for learners to have access to resources that are relevant and current.

### How Swag solves the problem
Because Swag is distributed, and resources can be shared freely among different installations (if possible), local learners who create resources based on new advancements can pass information to other learners who may not be aware for the changes.
