# Installing and replicating Swag

Swag is built on top of the content management system WordPress. WordPress powers more than a quarter of all Web Sites on the Internet, so even if you are not familiar with how to set up WordPress, there are good chances that you know someone who knows. We have tried to make the installation process as simple as possible, both for setting up the basic system as well as filling the system with learning resources. The step you need to go through to set up Swag are the following:

* Install WordPress.
* Download Swag from github.com/tunapanda/wp-swag.
* Copy the wp-swag directory into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. If you use a unix based operating system, don’t forget to change permissions if necessary.
* Log in to your wp-admin dashboard and click on the plugins menu on the left side of the screen. You should see the Swag plugin listed. Click ‘activate’ to activate the plugin.
* Click on Tunapanda Swag in the Settings menu and follow the instructions there. This will help you to install required plugins and download learning resources from the Tunapanda server.
