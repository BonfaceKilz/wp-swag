# Join us!

If you share our values, and if you believe that a system such as Swag can have an impact and help to make the world a better place, we invite you to join us!

There are a number of ways you can participate in the swag project.

## Programming
Swag is an open source project, and as such is developed by a dispersed team of developers from around the world. If you enjoy programming, we invite you to hack on Swag and make it better. Please see the list of issues as suggestions, if you think that they are boring or misses the mark about what is needed, hack on whatever you want!

## Testing
We have tried to make Swag easy to install and use. But have we succeeded? It is very valuable for us to hear your real life stories!

## Creating and sharing course material
We want Swag to be to school books what Wikipedia is to encyclopedias. If you want to share your course work
and make it available in the Swag system, this would be much welcome!

## Other contributions
Tunapanda, the creators of Swag, is a nonprofit organisation in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. We survive on contributions from the public, and every dollar helps! Please see our contributions page.
