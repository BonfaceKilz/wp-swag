# What makes Swag unique?

It is an offline platform and can exist entirely without needing internet and someone can get everything from another peer machine on a local network or a direct connection between the machine which reduces the need for internet connectivity. It has the chances to leapfrog education system in the west just like Mpesa or Mobile phones and since Mpesa caused a distribution in how people send, receive and bank money leapfrogging the traditional banking systems, we believe we can achieve the same but for education.

Swag is gamified. Rather than a linear learning experience, Swag offers a variety of options. Swag will trigger a person to learn and explore more there is also earning badges that gives sense of achievement and offers the need to collect more badges.

It is open and free, the code base is on github and anyone if free to contribute and make it better since. The content that is created is released under a public license and anyone can use as well as to download. We believe the cost barriers to learning should be minimized as much as possible.

It is easily replicable to any online system or locally and the system can be used to replicate another which is completely independent.

It allows version controls the same way as git and github which makes the system able to keep track of different versions between two systems and can synchronize them as required by the user.
